# Bike Theft Simulator #

## Summary ##

**Hi! You are now the freshest of freshman at the esteemed UC Davis, city of bikes! Unfortunately no one told you this and you have arrived without a bike. Luckily, you live in a top down rougelite where everyone has a bike but you. Don’t tell anyone I told you but I’ve heard these bikes turn a hefty profit! Every morning you will get a chance to explore the campus but don’t get caught. Walk up to a shiny bike and take out your lock cutters to chop away. Make sure to escape without getting caught or you could lose everything. Once you leave, give me a call and I’ll get you that paycheck lickity split! I have a couple of other items for sale if you’re ever interested let me know. Now go out there and STE… take a gander at those two wheeled bags of money eh?**

If your project contains code that: 1) your team did not write, and 2) does not fit cleanly into a role, please document it in this section. Please include the author of the code, where to find the code, and note which scripts, folders, or other files that comprise the external contribution. Additionally, include the license for the external code that permits you to use it. You do not need to include the license for code provided by the instruction team.

If you used tutorials or other intellectual guidance to create aspects of your project, include reference to that information as well.

For each team member, you should work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.
